# üêæ Veterinary Management System (Java Project)
One of project in my class, got 1.0 grade
## üìå Overview
This is a Java-based academic project developed as part of the course **Software Engineering and Programming Basic** at TU Chemnitz. The project simulates a basic veterinary management system where patients (animals) are registered, queued, and treated based on urgency and resource availability. The code is implemented using object-oriented programming concept and using unit test from by JUnit5.


### üí¨ User Stories

- When a new patient arrives, they are **registered and placed into the anteroom queue**.
- Patients are treated by a **doctor qualified** to handle their specific animal kind (dog, cat, bird, reptile, rodent).
- Doctors are assisted by **assistants** during treatment. For efficient operations, there must be **at least one assistant more than the number of doctors**. If not, treatment times will **double**.
- The clinic handles **emergency cases** with priority over regular ones.
- Once a case is completed, it is removed from the waiting list.
- The simulation tracks **treatment start and end times**, and returns a **log of executed cases** as formatted strings.
